# Pragmatic SBT

This presentation gives a pragmatic introduction to SBT - the Scala Build Tool -
in 7 examples. Each example is a build in it's own root directory: ./example??
Beginning with very simple sbt examples the later examples are becoming more
structured and more complex showing multi project builds and cross version builds.
